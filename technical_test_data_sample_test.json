People are constantly asking me about the shoes and I tell them how great __COMPANY__ are for running.  I've made a few purchases directly with the __COMPANY__ company website online, but mostly through Road Runner Sports USA at least three times a year with the VIP membership.  These are the only shoes I wear and I love promoting them to the general public.  I was wondering if this company could grant me with any sort of apparel e.g. hat, XL shirt's stickers - really anything.  I would be able to provide recent proofs of __COMPANY__ purchases from Road Runner.  Again, this company is great and would love to meet a rep. one of these day's at a local running shop.  \n\nIf __COMPANY__ would be able to provide me with any sort of apparel, it would be much appreciated.\nI will provide you my address for mail @  \n\n__NAME__\n__ADDRESS__\n\nAgain, I will still continue promoting this company.

We are heading into or second year and will name approximately 110 brand ambassadors next year.  Including 8 elites and 2 Challenged Athletes.  The past 2 years we've partnered with brands like Roka, Rudy Project and several others in nutrition, etc.  This year we will add Pioneer and Officine Mattio.  I personally love your shoes, and recently wore them, at Kona, in the annual fun UPR.  We would be interested in, and very excited to partner with, your brand encouraging our athletes to try your shoes, if they have not already.  We understand partnerships do not offer free product but discounts definitely encourage others to give a new brand a shot.  We would use your shoes in our upcoming professional shoots as well.  Our IG is @DixieDevilSport if you'd like to check us out. Thank you very much for your time.\n\nKindest Regards,\n\n__NAME__",
        "615":"I purchased a pair of OC running shoes last year. I had heard from friends that OC's where the best running shoe that they had ever worn. I have to agree, they are the most comfortable shoe I have put on. I have one complaint, my daughter accidently stepped on the back of the sole and it became detached from the shoe body. I tried to glue it back on, but after a could of weeks it detached again. I believe this to be a design flaw due to the fact that the back of the sole sticks out considerably and is easily stepped on or caught. What are my options? Now every time I wear the shoes, the side with the torn sole squeak's... very irritating.. now I cannot wear the shoes and I am hesitant to purchase another pair.. can you help me?\n \n\n thanks",

        "567":"\n\n\nHi,\n\nI am very interested in joining your influencer\/pro program.\n\nThrough my company Adventure Architects, I am dedicated to bringing the heads of companies and their teams into the outdoors to partake in a variety of outdoor activities ranging from SUP'ing, rock climbing, sailing, yoga, outdoor dining, meditation, surfing, heli skiing, snow mobiling, glamping, etc. I built this company to allow me to personally host most of these experiencing while balancing the responsibilities of being a CEO of a fast growing company. We are dedicated to supporting sustainable practices internally and externally (educating our clients on everything from carbon-offsetting, recycling, opting out of one time use plastics, and nurturing a positive appreciation for the environment.\n\nIt's also worth drawing attention to the community groups that we service (Summit.co & https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1bAPbUG_OmBstmmgY63ELsigAV_DoVceJ\/view , thebatterysf.com & WeWork). I believe these could be compelling for you as they create diverse exposure to an affluent user group who opt-in to have premium outdoor experiences and I imagine are well placed to become your customers. The most compelling of the group is probably the summit community for whom I personally host a variety of outdoor\/active experiences in Tulum, at Summit Powder Mountain and Los Angeles. Take a look at the deck I linked above.\n\nAdditionally, I volunteer as a cadet with Marin Search and Rescue. With approximately sixty active members, Marin County's Search and Rescue (Marin SAR) responds to searches for missing children and adults, evidence and other search requests in the county and on mutual aid calls anywhere in the state of California. Marin SAR is a mountain rescue Type I team with the motto of: \"Anytime, Anywhere, Any Weather.\" We just got back last night after 3 days of searching the Trinity Alps for missing hiker.\n\nAs an outdoor professional, I am always on the hunt for apparel and gear that lives at the intersection of functionality and style. I believe your products do just that and it would be an honor to rep your company in front of our audience.  - carina.hessmer@gmail.com\nOn Fri, Feb 24, 2012 at 10:19 AM, <examples@email.goalengine.com> wrote:\n\n> Give us an example of how you applied what they learned to achieve\n> something in your organization\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\n*Joe Smith | Director, Product Management*\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

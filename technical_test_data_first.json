I looked at your combo's and I was wondering if there's an option to make a change to the \"__PRODUCT_NAMES__\"? My wife needs a stability shoe so I'd like to get her a __PRODUCT_NAMES__, women's size 10 US (aqua & white is what comes up for Canada but the combo is purple and rose - either of which is fine) but I can't wear a stability shoe so I was hoping to exchange the second pair of __PRODUCT_NAMES__ for the same size in women's __PRODUCT_NAMES__, Flame & Shadow, US (W): 10. \n\nWe are a part of Search and Rescue and the reviews look great so I thought the __PRODUCT_NAMES__ would be a great second option as trail runners are typically more rigid soles. \n\nPlease let me know if we can make this a reality. \n\nThank you again!\n\nPS if ever you need a professional sales representative for the Pacific Northwest (US and Canada) I would love to represent your brand!!! I'm an avid outdoors person and stay active between hiking, running (on and off road), mountain biking, and crossfit 3-5 days per week. \n\nCheers,\n\n__NAME__",

        "567":"\n\n\nHi,\n\nI am very interested in joining your influencer\/pro program.\n\nThrough my company Adventure Architects, I am dedicated to bringing the heads of companies and their teams into the outdoors to partake in a variety of outdoor activities ranging from SUP'ing, rock climbing, sailing, yoga, outdoor dining, meditation, surfing, heli skiing, snow mobiling, glamping, etc. I built this company to allow me to personally host most of these experiencing while balancing the responsibilities of being a CEO of a fast growing company. We are dedicated to supporting sustainable practices internally and externally (educating our clients on everything from carbon-offsetting, recycling, opting out of one time use plastics, and nurturing a positive appreciation for the environment.\n\nIt's also worth drawing attention to the community groups that we service (Summit.co & https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1bAPbUG_OmBstmmgY63ELsigAV_DoVceJ\/view , thebatterysf.com & WeWork). I believe these could be compelling for you as they create diverse exposure to an affluent user group who opt-in to have premium outdoor experiences and I imagine are well placed to become your customers. The most compelling of the group is probably the summit community for whom I personally host a variety of outdoor\/active experiences in Tulum, at Summit Powder Mountain and Los Angeles. Take a look at the deck I linked above.\n\nAdditionally, I volunteer as a cadet with Marin Search and Rescue. With approximately sixty active members, Marin County's Search and Rescue (Marin SAR) responds to searches for missing children and adults, evidence and other search requests in the county and on mutual aid calls anywhere in the state of California. Marin SAR is a mountain rescue Type I team with the motto of: \"Anytime, Anywhere, Any Weather.\" We just got back last night after 3 days of searching the Trinity Alps for missing hiker.\n\nAs an outdoor professional, I am always on the hunt for apparel and gear that lives at the intersection of functionality and style. I believe your products do just that and it would be an honor to rep your company in front of our audience.  - carina.hessmer@gmail.com\nOn Fri, Feb 24, 2012 at 10:19 AM, <examples@email.goalengine.com> wrote:\n\n> Give us an example of how you applied what they learned to achieve\n> something in your organization\n\n\n\n\n-- \n\n*Joe Smith | Director, Product Management*\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.

        "586":"Hello!\nAfter reading so many great reviews, I was very excited to try _PRODUCT_NAME_ shoes.  However, they have not worked out for me.  My feet and knees are more sore than they have been since I started running 5 years ago.  I haven't been able to run for the past two weeks.  I've been walking in the _PRODUCT_NAME_ shoes I bought and I am still experiencing pain in my feet and knees.  I usually wear _PRODUCT_NAME_ or _PRODUCT_NAME_ for my running shoes and I was confident these would be superior to those brands, but my experience has not been a positive one.  I am outside of the 30 day purchase window.  I save all year to buy a new pair of running shoes each _DATE_ (lowly teachers' salary) and am thoroughly disappointed by the discomfort these shoes have given me.  I prefer to not post negative reviews online because I am sure that for many people they are great.  Is there anything you can do to help me?  I need to be able to keep up my daily running routine but I won't be able to buy another pair of shoes until next summer.  Please help!\nSent from my iphone",

I feel _COMPANY_ truly stands by their products and the quality has been exceptional for clean beauty.\n\nI'm writing to you because I purchased a  _PRODUCT_NAME_, order number _ORDER_NUMBER_ and  _PRODUCT_NAME_ order number _ORDER_NUMBER_.\n\nI purchased the foundation considering I was about to run low on the one I already had; and recently opened the foundation on _DATE_since I ran out. The quality of the foundation application was not as smooth compared to my prior purchase. \nThe concern I have with the  _PRODUCT_NAME_ is that I'm unable to use it comfortably. I thought it needed some time for me to \"break it in\" but that never occurred. As a result, I didn't use it as often because I got tired of breaking it apart with a needle to get the pigment onto the brush. If the products gets returned to your facility, you can see how I had to keep breaking the _PRODUCT_NAME_ and how much i haven't used the  _PRODUCT_NAME_ and the full amount of the foundation in the tube.\n\nYou guys have been great in resolving minor problems where I received a wrong product or one of my product had two of the same eyeshadow color.  What is the best solution for these two items?\n\nThank you and hope we can find a solution to my concerns.\n_NAME_\n\n\n",

This seems to happen a lot. At first it was okay, because I imagine you do run out of things, but when it happens nearly every other month, then it becomes more of a nuisance. Perhaps you could let us know a month before so we can make a change? This seems to happen a lot, and quite honestly, it gets annoying after awhile.\n\nNext, the real reason I am reaching out:\n\n#2- My latest shipment was a repeat shipment, containing the exact same perfumes as the month before. (_PRODUCT_NAME_ and _PRODUCT_NAME_.) \nWhat makes your subscription unique is that we get to try new and unique perfumes. While I do like these scents, I do not want to pay the price for repeat perfumes. Which leads me to...\n\n#3- Can you please send me two new perfumes from my queue to replace this order?

I recently received  my order, and unfortunately, one of the perfumes that was in the atomizer was empty, so I took the vial out, and the top wasn't screwed in all the way and there was some liquid in the bottom of the _PRODUCT_NAME_. It was the _PRODUCT_NAME_,  which I was really looking forward to. I am hoping that if I send back the empty vial that you can replace it?? Please let me know where to send it. Also, the _PRODUCT_NAME_ I received was supposed to be _PRODUCT_NAME_ but is red instead. I don't mind the red so much, but unfortunately around where I live there is gang activity, and our local law enforcement encourages the public not to wear or show any dark blue or red colors in order to not get messed with by the gangs.
